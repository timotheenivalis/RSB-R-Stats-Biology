# Mixed models 3: Random interactions and correlated random effects

In this session we will explore random effects fitted to the effect of predictors (a.k.a. random interactions, random slopes, random regressions...).
Why do we sometimes *need* them, and what they can tell us about biological processes.
In a second time we will see how to create correlated random effects to create genetic, phylogenetic or spatial models.
